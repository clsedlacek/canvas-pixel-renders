# Canvas Pixel Renders
HTML5 Canvas rendering toy for testing pixel manipulation and procedural pattern/noise algorithms.

**==Warning: some of these patterns may cause eye-strain or trigger photosensitive epilepsy.==** I tried to mark anything animated that strobes or changes quickly. Many of these patterns are repetitive, high-contrast, etc. and I would recommend avoiding this project entirely if you are prone to seizures triggered by static images.
